Re-implementing karpathy@'s micro-grad

# Overview

In Feb 2023, as the AI wave swept the world, I stumbled upon Andrej Karpathy's youtube channel. His [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&t=7990s) on backpropagation is the simplest and clearest explanation I know on how Neural Nets and Backpropagation work. 

15 mins into the video, I quickly spun up a notebook on the side and started re-implementing the micrograd library as I learnt through the video. I tested it against the Iris data set which is typically used for multi-class problems but I customized it into a binary classification dataset. It was fun to build your own scalar engine that can be used to build a small but powerful (powerful enough to overfit and achieve 100% accuracy) neural net for educational purposes.
